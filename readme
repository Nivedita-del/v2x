Simulation of V2X communication system using DSRC framework with WLAN and Analysis of how vehicles transfer data within less period time.


In the current scenario, 5g technology is used for network communication in autonomous cars. Due to this technology there’s a communication lag between two systems. To resolve this problem we are using WLAN (wireless local area network) with DSRC (Dedicated short range communication technology . 5g is an open network . Open networks are usually prone to hacking. To resolve this we use WLAN with security. In the present technology there’s a latency (such as processing delay and delay due to contention) in communication. In this project we’ll use faster WiFi modules and reduce the latency in order to achieve seamless connection.
